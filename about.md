KyleBits is the online home of Kyle Davis.  There are many people named Kyle Davis, and if you found me in a random web search, history teaches I’m probably not the one you were looking for.  

If it helps, I’m not a musician, attorney, real estate agent, or financial advisor.  I’m a computer geek.  I’ve lived near Albany NY, Rochester NY, Fairfax VA, Boston MA, Dallas and Houston TX, among other places.  If you think I’m the guy you were looking for, contact me via Twitter (link at the bottom of the page).
